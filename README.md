# UVA-Solve

My solutions to the UVA problems that I have solved successfully. I have created all of the code myself.

I'm currently in Software Engineering at the Daffodil International University.

These are usually not the most optimal solutions, but they all are accepted within the given time limit.

My UVA account is ismail5g.

Feel free to look at these solutions for assistance on a problem, but please don't just copy my solutions, because there is no point in doing so.
